On the Other Hand...
====================

TuxCraft's Modjam December 2013 submission.

On the Other Hand (OOH) is a mod that adds dual wielding to minecraft. Well I bet you are saying "Why dual wielding? Hasn't that already been done?" Yes, but in the instances I have seen it in dual wielding features have been limited to that mod, maybe with a few exceptions. OOH, besides having a really cool name, will have blanket support for all minecraft items / blocks, including mod items unless that mod is doing some funky stuffs. Not only that but OOH will also be a regular mod, partly because I have no idea how to coremod and partly because I know it can be done without. And if I have time I would also like to add shields. Depends though, I only get 96 hours.

So let's review what is OOH?
- a dual wielding mod that...
- is not a coremod
- has unlimited item support
- is made in 96 hours
- and has a really cool name

How much better can you get? :D

To compile for yourself set isObfuscated in the main class file to true then run recompile.sh and reobfuscate_srg.sh as as usual.


How to Play:
====================
When you load up a world for the first time you will be in dual wield mode. To disengage dual wield press 'f' by default, but that key bind can be configured. To re-engage dual wield simply press 'f' again. You can scroll through your inventory like you normally could without dual wielding allowing you to dual wield anything in your hotbar. All of your items will function as if they were right clicked. The few exceptions to the rule are your tools and your sword. They will be able to break blocks and attack entities. Your normal hand will function as both. If a block can be right clicked it will right click, if not it will mine or hit mobs. Thank you so much for downloading, hope you enjoy OOH! :D
