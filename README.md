On the Other Hand...
====================

TuxCraft's Modjam December 2013 submission.

On the Other Hand (OOH) is a mod that adds dual wielding to minecraft. Well I bet you are saying "Why dual wielding? Hasn't that already been done?" Yes, but in the instances I have seen it in dual wielding features have been limited to that mod, maybe with a few exceptions. OOH, besides having a really cool name, will have blanket support for all minecraft items / blocks, including mod items unless that mod is doing some funky stuffs. Not only that but OOH will also be a regular mod, partly because I have no idea how to coremod and partly because I know it can be done without. And if I have time I would also like to add shields. Depends though, I only get 96 hours.

So let's review what is OOH?
- a dual wielding mod that...
- is not a coremod
- has unlimited item support
- might add shields
- is made in 96 hours
- and has a really cool name

How much better can you get? :D

To compile for yourself set isObfuscated in the main class file to true then run recompile.sh and reobfuscate_srg.sh as asual.
